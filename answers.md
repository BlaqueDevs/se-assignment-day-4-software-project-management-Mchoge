Effective Cost Control in Software Projects
Cost control prevents financial waste, ensures profitability, and maintains project scope. Strategies include:

Establishing a detailed budget and contingency plans.
Regularly tracking expenses against the budget.
Using cost-effective resources and avoiding scope creep through clear requirements.
Agile vs. Waterfall Methodologies

Agile: Flexible, iterative approach allowing frequent updates and customer feedback.
Advantages: Adaptability, faster delivery, and improved collaboration.
Disadvantages: Requires skilled teams and less predictable outcomes.
Waterfall: Linear, sequential approach with clear stages and documentation.
Advantages: Simplicity, well-defined scope, and easier documentation.
Disadvantages: Inflexible and slow to adapt to changes.
When to Use Agile vs. Waterfall

Agile: Suitable for dynamic projects requiring flexibility, like mobile app development or startups.
Waterfall: Best for projects with clear requirements, like construction software or compliance-driven projects.
Quality Assurance in Software Projects
Ensuring quality involves:

Conducting regular testing (unit, integration, and regression).
Implementing peer reviews and automated testing tools.
Maintaining documentation and adhering to standards.
High standards reduce errors, enhance user satisfaction, and build credibility.
